_Finally, Better Web Help for the DITA OT_

---

Built as a plugin for the DITA Open Toolkit, Better Web Help (BWH) is a frameless adaptation of the XHMTL output. It is designed to be very customizable and easy to adapt.

##Documentation
Within the Documentation/ folder, there are files that describe how to install the plugin into your Local DITA-OT build in addition to how to install it into an instance of easyDITA.

##Sample Output
To load the sample output (/bwh) follow the instructions to get a localhost server running on your machine (/Documentation/Installation/Installing_BWH.pdf). Then copy /bwh into your /Library/WebServer/Documents/ folder.

##Sponsor
This project is sponsored by [Jorsek LLC, makers of easyDITA software](http://www.easydita.com).
