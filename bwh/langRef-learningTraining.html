<h1 class="title topictitle1">Learning and training elements</h1>

<p class="shortdesc">Elements in the Learning and Training section include specialized
topic types designed for learning and training content, as well as specialized
domain elements for organizing learning content within maps, specifying
learning metadata, and describing learning interactions.</p>

<div class="related-links">
<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/lc_spec_topics.html">Learning and training topic elements</a></strong><br/>
Use the learning and training topic types to provide the instructional content, according to the needs identified by the learning goals and objectives. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/lc_spec_learning_map.html">Learning and training map domain elements</a></strong><br/>
Use the learning and training map domain to organize groups of topics as learning objects. Defined as a map domain, these elements are available for use within any DITA map, not just a learning-specific DITA map. For example, you could include learning objects in a DITA generic map or in a DITA bookmap.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/lc_spec_interactions_domain.html">Learning and training interactions domain elements</a></strong><br/>
Use the learning interactions to construct a basic set of question and response interaction. The domain also provides an lcInstructornote element, which you can use to provide instructor-specific information in the learning topics.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/lc_spec_lom.html">Learning and training metadata elements</a></strong><br/>
Use the learning and training metadata to describe specific characteristics of the learning content. The learning and training metadata elements provide a robust metadata model for learning objects, built upon industry standards and best practices. Defined as a domain, these elements are available for use in both the topic prolog and the map topicmeta. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/learning_training_elements_other.html">Other learning and training elements</a></strong><br/>
This group includes those elements that are specifically related to learning, but do not fit in to one of the other major learning groups.</li>
</ul>

<div class="familylinks">
<div class="parentlink"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="language_reference.html" title="The language reference provides information about each element in the DITA vocabulary modules. It is divided into three sections: Base, technical content, and learning and training. It also includes a section titled &#34;Attributes&#34; that applies to all three of the preceding sections.">Language reference</a></div>
