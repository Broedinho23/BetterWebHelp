<div xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="related-links">
<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/changes-from-previous-versions.html">Changes from previous versions</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The following topics outline the changes from earlier versions of DITA     to the current version.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/migration-1_1-to-1_2.html">Migrating from DITA 1.1 to 1.2</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) DITA 1.2 is compatible with prior versions of the DITA specification in   that all valid DITA 1.0 and 1.1 documents are valid DITA 1.2 documents. However, some changes to   existing document type shells and specializations might be needed in order to maintain the same   behavior under DITA 1.2 or to take full advantage of new DITA 1.2 features.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/DITA-mime-type.html">DITA MIME type</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) It is common for Web-based services to establish default actions for     content based on the MIME type value sent in HTTP headers. For example, the     "text/html" MIME type is what normally causes browsers to interpret the content of a     web page as presentation-oriented markup, verus "text/plain" which would cause the     markup to be displayed literally. A DITA MIME type enables applications to recognize content as     DITA to enable special services such as semantically-informed search indexing or on-the-fly     rendering in the browser.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/foreigngeneralization.html">Considerations for generalizing &lt;foreign&gt; elements</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) Generalization of a DITA element employs the value of its @class     attribute. The content of a &lt;foreign&gt; element, or of a specialization of the     &lt;foreign&gt; element, cannot be generalized because there are no DITA elements in it, and     therefore no @class attributes. The non-DITA contents can only be processed by appropriate     non-DITA means.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/elementsMerged.html">Element-by-element recommendations for translators</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) This topic contains a list of all OASIS DITA elements. It includes     recommendations on how to present the element type to translators, whether the element contents     are likely to be suitable for translation, and whether the element has attributes whose values     are likely to be suitable for translation. Examples of content that is not suitable for     translation include code fragments and mailing addresses.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/dita-module-impl-ref.html">DITA module and shell implementation reference</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The DITA standard defines a set of base types and vocabulary modules     and a set of specialized map types, topic types, and domains. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/dtdorganization.html">DTD organization</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The OASIS DITA document types are implemented with a set of DTD     modules. Some of these modules are used by every DITA document type, others are only used by     topics or by maps, and some are only used in specific specializations.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/schemaorganization.html">XML schema organization</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The OASIS DITA document types are implemented with a set of schema     modules. Some of these modules are used by every DITA schema document, others are     only used by topics or by maps, and some are only used in specific specializations.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/filenaming-processing-modules.html">Processing component modularization and naming conventions</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/interoperability-considerations.html">Processing interoperability considerations</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The DITA specification does not require processors to perform     filtering, content reference resolution, key space construction, and other processing related to     base DITA semantics in any particular order. This means that different conforming DITA     processors may produce different results for the same initial data set and filtering conditions.     DITA users and DITA implementers need to be aware of these potential differences in behavior     when DITA content will be processed by different processors.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="non-normative/../non-normative/speclimits.html">Specialization design, customization, and the limits of specialization</a></strong><br/>
(Non-normative) The DITA specialization facility necessarily imposes some constraints.     An inherent challenge in designing DITA vocabulary modules and document types is understanding     how best to satisfy markup requirements within those constraints and, when requirements cannot     be met within the DITA-defined constraints, how to create "customized" document types that     diverge from DITA requirements as little as possible.</li>
