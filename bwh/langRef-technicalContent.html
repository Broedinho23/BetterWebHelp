<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/concept2.html">Concept elements</a></strong><br/>
DITA concept topics answer "What is..." questions. Use the concept topic to introduce the background or overview information for tasks or reference topics. The concept topic restricts content following a section or example to other sections or examples. For more details on when to use concept and other information types, please refer to the DITA architectural specification.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/task2.html">Task elements</a></strong><br/>
Task topics answer "How do I?" questions, and have a well-defined structure that describes how to complete a procedure to accomplish a specific goal. Use the task topic to describe the steps of a particular task, or to provide an overview of a higher-level task. The task topic includes sections for describing the context, prerequisites, actual steps, expected results, example, and expected next steps for a task. For more details on when to use task and other information types, please refer to the DITA architectural specification.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/reference2.html">Reference elements</a></strong><br/>
Reference topics describe factual material about a subject, such as the commands in a programming language. This format is also suitable for bibliographies, catalogues, the list of ingredients for recipes, and similar collections of structured descriptive prose. For more details on when to use reference and other information types, please refer to the DITA architectural specification.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/glossary-elements.html">Glossary elements</a></strong><br/>
Glossary elements include those elements designed to specify terms and their definitions, as well as elements that are designed to group, reference, or otherwise make use of information in the glossentry topic.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/bookmap-elements.html">Bookmap elements</a></strong><br/>
Elements in the bookmap section are used to organize DITA content into book form. They include elements for dividing up content, such as chapter and appendix, as well as metadata specific to publishing.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./common/technicalContent-domain-elements.html">Domain elements</a></strong><br/>
Domains in this section include those generally associated with technical content, such as the programming and software domains.</li>
