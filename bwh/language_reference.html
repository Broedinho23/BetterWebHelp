 <p class="shortdesc">The language reference provides information about each element in the DITA vocabulary
  modules. It is divided into three sections: Base, technical content, and learning and training. It
  also includes a section titled "Attributes" that applies to all three of the preceding

<div class="related-links">
<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="langRef-base.html">Base elements</a></strong><br/>
Base elements include the core DITA topic and map elements that are the building blocks for other specializations as well as several basic specializations that are not applicable to a specific information domain.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="langRef-technicalContent.html">Technical content elements</a></strong><br/>
Elements in the technical content section include the original Concept, Task, and Reference specializations, as well as the Bookmap and Glossary specializations added with DITA 1.1. It also includes domains designed primarily for technical content, such as the task requirements and software domains.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="langRef-learningTraining.html">Learning and training elements</a></strong><br/>
Elements in the Learning and Training section include specialized topic types designed for learning and training content, as well as specialized domain elements for organizing learning content within maps, specifying learning metadata, and describing learning interactions.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/attributes.html">Attributes</a></strong><br/>
Many DITA attributes are reused in groups or are too complex to describe in the usual table cell format. Those attributes are collected in this section.</li>
