<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec-base.html">Architectural Specification: Base</a></strong><br/>
Base DITA includes the topic, map elements, metadata, classification, and specialization   elements. It also includes domains for hazard statement, typographic, and utility   elements</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec-technicalContent.html">Architectural Specification: Technical Content Version</a></strong><br/>
Previously, the document types and specializations for technical content were included   as an integral part of the base DITA specification. With the release of DITA 1.2 and the   increasingly number of specializations that are part of the DITA specification, the document types   and specializations for technical content have a dedicated section in the DITA   specification.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec-learningTraining.html">Architectural Specification: Learning and Training Version</a></strong><br/>
DITA 1.2 introduces the Learning and Training specialization, which is designed for   developing instructional materials. It contains all of base DITA and some (but not all) parts of   the Technical Content package.</li>
