<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The &lt;<span class="keyword">simpletable</span>&gt; element is used
for tables that are regular in structure and do not need a caption.
Choose the simple table element when you want to show information
in regular rows and columns. For example, multi-column tabular data
such as phone directory listings or parts lists are good candidates
for simpletable. Another good use of simpletable is for information
that seems to beg for a three-part definition list; the keycol attribute
may be used to indicate which column represents the "key" or term-like
column of your structure.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">This close match of simpletable to tabular, regular data
makes simpletable suitable as the basis for specialized structures
such as <a class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="properties.html" title="The &lt;properties&gt; element gives a list of properties for the subject of the current topic, for example whether a class is public or protected. Each property can include the type, value, and a description. The typical rendering is usually in a table-like format.
