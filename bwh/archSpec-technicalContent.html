 <p class="shortdesc">Previously, the document types and specializations for technical content were included
  as an integral part of the base DITA specification. With the release of DITA 1.2 and the
  increasingly number of specializations that are part of the DITA specification, the document types
  and specializations for technical content have a dedicated section in the DITA
  specification.</p>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec/dita-1.2_technicalContent_overview.html">Overview of the DITA 1.2 Specification: Technical Content</a></strong><br/>
This section describes the DITA document types and specializations for technical   content.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec/dita_technicalContent_InformationTypes.html">Technical content: Document and information types</a></strong><br/>
The Technical Content package contains five topic specializations that support seven   document types: concept, reference, general task, strict task, machinery task, glossary entry, and   glossary group. These topic types are specialized from the base topic and are designed   specifically for information that describes how to use products and processes they are dominated   by procedural, task-oriented information. The Technical Content package also includes   the map document type. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec/dita_technicalContent_TopicDomains.html">Topic domains: Technical content</a></strong><br/>
A DITA domain defines a set of elements associated with a particular subject area or   authoring requirement. DITA incorporates several domains into the Technical Content   specializations. Other domains are incorporated into basic DITA.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="./archSpec/xNALDomain.html">The xNAL domain</a></strong><br/>
The DITA xNAL domain specialization defines a number of metadata elements and attributes   that are useful in representing personal/organizational names and addresses. The metadata can be   used to identify authors and content owners. The OASIS xNAL Standard (extensible Name and Address   Langauge) was selected to represent close mappings from the DITA bookmap metadata content model to   an existing standard. xNAL is included in the Bookmap and the LearningBookmap document   types.</li>
