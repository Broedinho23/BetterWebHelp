<p class="shortdesc">The base topic elements include elements that make up the
core building blocks of the DITA topic, such as topic, body, and related-links,
as well as elements like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;ph&gt; that are used in many
topic specializations. Some of these elements are also available inside
the &lt;topicmeta&gt; map element.</p>

<ol class="olchildlinks">
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/../common/topic2.html">Basic topic elements</a><br/>
The generic topic structure is used for untyped topics. While much of the DITA architecture is built on generic topics, it is generally better to use more specific information types (such as concept, task, or reference) when they are available.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/../common/body2.html">Body elements</a><br/>
The body elements support the most common types of content authoring for topics: paragraphs, lists, phrases, figures, and other common types of exhibits in a document.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/../common/table2.html">Table elements</a><br/>
DITA topics support two types of tables. The &lt;<span class="keyword">table</span>&gt; element uses the OASIS Exchange Table Model (formerly known as the CALS table model). The OASIS table supports the spanning of multiple rows or columns for special layout or organizational needs, and provides a wide variety of controls over the display properties of the data and even the table structure itself.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="common/../common/relatedl.html">Related links elements</a><br/>
The related-links section of DITA topics is a special structure that contains links. Links support navigation from a topic to other related topics or resources.</li>
