<h1 class="title topictitle1">The conaction attribute</h1>


<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The conaction attribute allows users to push content from
one topic into another. It causes the conref attribute to work in
reverse, so that the content is pushed from the current topic into
another, rather than pulled from another topic into the current one.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In the descriptions below, the word <em class="ph i">target</em> always
refers to the element referenced by a conref attribute.</div>
<p class="p">There
are three possible functions using the conaction attribute: replacing
an element, pushing content before an element, and pushing content
after an element. The conaction attribute always declares the desired
function while the conref attribute provides the target of the reference
using the standard conref syntax.</p>
<p class="p">In each case, an element pushed
using conref must be of the same type as, or more specialized than,
its target. If the pushed element is more specialized than the target,
then it should be generalized when the conref is resolved. This ensures
that the content will be valid in the target topic.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">It is valid to push using conref when the two elements involved
are of the same type. For example, a step element may use conref push
with another step as the target of the conref.</li>

<li class="li">The target element may be more general than the source. For example,
it is legal to push a &lt;step&gt; element to replace a general list
item (li); the step element should be generalized back to a list item
during the process.</li>

<li class="li">It is not possible to push a more general element into a specialized
context. For example, it is not legal to push a list item (&lt;li&gt;)
in order to replace a &lt;step&gt;, because the list item allows many
items that are not valid in the specialized context.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Replacing content in another topic</h2><p class="p">When
the conaction attribute is set to "pushreplace", the source element
will replace the target specified on the conref attribute. The pushed
content remains in the source topic where it was originally authored.</p>
<div class="p">For
example, assume that a task in example.dita has the id "example",
and contains a step with the id "b": <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="example" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Example topic&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;taskbody&gt;
    &lt;steps&gt;
      &lt;step id="a"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;A&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="b"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="c"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;C&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;/steps&gt;
  &lt;/taskbody&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">In order to replace the step with id="b",
another topic must combine a conaction value of "pushreplace" with
a conref attribute that references this step:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="other" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  ...
   &lt;step conaction="pushreplace" 
         conref="example.dita#example/b"&gt;
     &lt;cmd&gt;Updated B&lt;/cmd&gt;
   &lt;/step&gt;
  ...
&lt;/task&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The result will be an updated version
of example.dita which contains the pushed step:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="example" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Example topic&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;taskbody&gt;
    &lt;steps&gt;
      &lt;step id="a"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;A&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="b"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Updated B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="c"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;C&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;/steps&gt;
  &lt;/taskbody&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">When
resolving a conref push action, attributes are resolved using the
same precedence as for normal conref, with one exception. Attributes
on the element with the conref attribute (in this case, the source
doing the push) will take priority over those on the referenced element.
The exception is that if the source element does not specify an ID,
the ID on the referenced element remains; if the source element does
specify an ID then that replaces the ID on the referenced element.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> It
is an error for two source topics to replace the same element. Applications
may, but need not, warn users if more than one element attempts to
replace a single target.</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pushing content before or after another element</h2><p class="p">Setting
the conaction attribute to "pushbefore" allows an element to be pushed
before the element referenced by the conref attribute. Likewise, setting
the conaction attribute to "pushafter" allows an element to be pushed
after the element referenced by the conref attribute. Multiple sources
may push content before or after the same target; the order in which
that content is pushed is undefined. </p>
<p class="p">When an element is pushed
before or after a target, the resulting document will have at least
two of that element. Because this is not always valid, a document
attempting to push content before or after a target must take an extra
step to ensure that the result will be valid. The extra step makes
use of the conaction="mark" value.</p>
<p class="p">When pushing before, the
conref attribute itself looks just as it did when replacing, but the
conaction attribute is set to "mark" because it is marking the target
element. This element remains empty; its purpose is to ensure that
it is legal to have more than one of the current element. Immediately
before the element which marks the target, you will place the content
that you actually want to push. This element will set the conaction
attribute to "pushbefore".</p>
<p class="p">When pushing after, the procedure
is the same, except that the order of the elements is reversed. The
element with conaction="pushafter" comes immediately after the element
which marks the target.</p>
<p class="p">Attributes on the element which is pushed
(the one with conaction="pushbefore") must be retained on the target,
apart from the conaction attribute itself. If this causes the result
document to end up with duplicate IDs, an application may (but need
not) recover by dropping the duplicate ID, modifying it to ensure
uniqueness, or warning the user.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The following restrictions
apply when pushing content before or after an element: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The elements that use conaction="mark" and conaction="pushbefore"
must be the same type as each other and must appear in sequence. This
restriction prevents a topic from trying to push a &lt;body&gt; element
before or after another &lt;body&gt; element, because it is not valid
to have two body elements in sequence.</li>

<li class="li">The container elements of the source and target must match, or
the container of the source element may be a specialization of the
target's container. This is also to ensure validity of the target;
for example, while it is possible to include multiple titles in a
section, it is not possible to do so in a figure. Comparing the parents
prevents a second section title from being pushed before a figure
title (the resulting figure would not be valid DITA). This restriction
only applies to the pushbefore or pushafter actions, not to the pushreplace
action.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">When content is pushed from one topic to another, it
is still rendered in the original context. Processors may delete empty
the element that with the conaction="mark" attribute. In order to
push content from a topic without actually rendering that topic on
its own, the topic should be referenced from the map with the processing-role
attribute set to "resource-only".</p>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example: pushing an element before the target</h2><div class="p">The
following example pushes a step before "b" in the example.dita file
shown above. <pre class="pre codeblock">  &lt;step conaction="pushbefore"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Do this before B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
  &lt;step conaction="mark"
        conref="example.dita#example/b"/&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The result
contains the pushed step element before "b".<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="example" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Example topic&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;taskbody&gt;
    &lt;steps&gt;
      &lt;step id="a"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;A&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Do this before B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="b"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="c"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;C&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;/steps&gt;
  &lt;/taskbody&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example: pushing an element after the target</h2><div class="p">Pushing
an element after a target is exactly the same as pushing before, except
that the order of the "mark" element and the pushed element are reversed.<pre class="pre codeblock">  &lt;step conaction="mark"
        conref="example.dita#example/b"/&gt;
  &lt;step conaction="pushafter"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Do this AFTER B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">In this case the resulting document has the pushed
content after step b:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="example" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Example topic&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;taskbody&gt;
    &lt;steps&gt;
      &lt;step id="a"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;A&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="b"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Do this AFTER B&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;step id="c"&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;C&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;/steps&gt;
  &lt;/taskbody&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Combining conaction with conkeyref or conrefend</h2><p class="p">The conkeyref attribute may be used
as an indirect way to specify a conref target. If the conkeyref attribute
is specified on an element that also uses the conaction attribute,
the conkeyref attribute is used to determine the target of the conref
push (as it would normally be used to determine the target of conref).</p>
<p class="p">The
conref push function does not provide the ability to push a range
of elements, so it is an error to specify the conrefend attribute
together with the conaction attribute. If the two are specified together
an application may (but need not) recover by warning the user and
ignoring the conrefend attribute.</p>
