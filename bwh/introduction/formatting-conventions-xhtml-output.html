    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Given the size and complexity of the specification, it is not generated as a single
        XHTML file. Instead, each DITA topic is rendered as a separate XHTML file. The XHTML version
        of the specification uses certain formatting conventions to aid readers in navigating
        through the specification and locating material easily: Link previews and navigation links. </p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Link previews</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The DITA 1.2 specification uses the content of the unique DITA &lt;shortdesc&gt; element
                to provide link previews for its readers. These link previews are visually
                highlighted by a border and a colored background. The link previews are not
                normative; they contain the content of the &lt;shortdesc&gt; element for the child
                topic, which is normatively rendered as the first paragraph of the child topic; the
                content is identical in both renditions. The link previews serve as enhanced
                navigation aids, enabling readers to more easily locate content. This usability
                enhancement is one of the ways in which the specification illustrates the
                capabilities of DITA and exemplifies DITA best practices.</p>

            <div class="p">The following screen capture illustrates how link previews are displayed in the XHTML

            <div class="p">To ease readers in navigating from one topic to another, each XHTML file generated by
