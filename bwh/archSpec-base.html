The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML-based architecture for         authoring, producing, and delivering topic-oriented, information-typed content that can be         reused and single-sourced in a variety of ways. While DITA historically has been driven by         the requirements of large-scale technical documentation authoring, management, and delivery,         it is a standard that is applicable to any kind of publication or information that might be         presented to readers, including interactive training and educational materials, standards,         reports, business documents, trade books, travel and nature guides, and more. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/ditamarkup.html">DITA markup</a></strong><br/>
Topics and maps are the basic building blocks of the Darwin Information Typing   Architecture (DITA). Metadata attributes and values can be added to DITA topics and maps, as well   as to elements within topics, to allow for conditional publishing and content reuse. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/behaviors.html">DITA processing</a></strong><br/>
Several common DITA processing behaviors are driven by attributes, including setting         the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which a DITA document depends, navigation,         linking, content reuse (via direct or indirect addressing), conditional processing,         chunking, and printing. In addition, translation of DITA content is expedited through the         use of the @dir, @translate, and @xml:lang attributes, and the &lt;index-sort-as&gt;         element.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/configuration-specialization-and-constraints.html">Configuration, specialization, and constraints</a></strong><br/>
The extension facilities of DITA allow existing vocabulary and constraint modules to be     combined to create specific DITA document types. Additionally, vocabulary modules can be     extended to create more-specialized markup to meet new requirements not satisfied by existing     markup. </li>
</ul>
