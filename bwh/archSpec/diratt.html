 <h1 class="title topictitle1">The dir attribute</h1>

 
 
 <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The dir attribute provides direction about how processors should render bidirectional
  text. Languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, and Yiddish have text written from right to
  left. Numerics and embedded sections of Western language text, however, are written from left to
  right. Some multilingual documents also contain a mixture of text segments in two directions. This
  attribute specifies how such text should be rendered to a reader.</p>

  <div class="section">
   
   
   <div class="p">Bidirectional text processing is controlled by several factors:<ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">The xml:lang attribute may be used to identify text that requires bidirectional
      rendering. The Unicode Bidirectional algorithm provides the means to properly identify western
      content in mixed text.
      </li>

     <li class="li">The dir attribute may be set on the root element,<span class="ph"> in combination with the
       xml:lang attribute</span>. <span class="ph">For example, to correctly set in a web browser a text
       in Arabic with embedded English content, the root element should be set with xml:lang="ar"
       and dir="rtl". All text, including punctuation marks, will be set correctly. </span></li>

     <li class="li">The dir attribute may be set to either "ltr" or "rtl" on an element in the
       document.</li>

     <li class="li">The dir attribute may be set to either "lro" or "rlo" on an element in the document.
      </li>

    </ul>
</div>

   <p class="p">The Unicode bidirectional algorithm positions the punctuation correctly for a given language.
    The rendering is responsible for displaying the text properly.
    </p>

   <p class="p">The use of the dir attribute and the Unicode algorithm is explained in the article <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="xref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir" target="_blank"> Specifying the
     direction of text and tables: the dir attribute
     (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir) </a>. This article contains
    several examples of how to use the dir attribute set to either left-to-right or right-to-left.
    There is no example of setting the dir attribute to either "lro" or "rlo", although it can be
    inferred from the example that uses the &lt;bdo&gt; element, a now-deprecated W3C mechanism for
    overriding the entire Unicode bidirectional algorithm.</p>

   <p class="p">Note that properly written mixed text does not need any special markers. The Unicode
    bidirectional algorithm is sufficient. However, some rendering systems may need directions for
    displaying bidirectional text, such as Arabic, properly. For example, the Apache FOP tool may
    not render Arabic properly unless the left-to-right and right-to-left indicators are used.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recommended usage</h2>
   
   <p class="p">The dir attribute, together with the xml:lang attribute, is essential for rendering table
    columns and definition lists &lt;dl&gt; to ensure proper order.</p>

   <div class="p">In general text, the Unicode Bidirectional algorithm, as specified by the xml:lang attribute
    together with the dir attribute, provides for various levels of bidirectionality, as follows:<ul class="ul" id="diratt__ul_2e2dcdcf-9265-4f9e-b49b-a67af4e4a94c">
     <li class="li">Directionality is either explicitly specified <span class="ph">via the xml:lang
       attribute in combination with the dir attribute</span> on the highest level element (topic or
      derived peer for topics, map for ditamaps) or assumed by the processing application. If used,
      it is recommended to specify the dir attribute on the highest level element in the topic or
      document element of the map. </li>

     <li class="li">When embedding a right-to-left text run inside a left-to-right text run (or vice-versa),
      the default direction <span class="ph">may</span> provide incorrect results based on the rendering
      mechanism, especially if the embedded text run includes punctuation that is located at one end
      of the embedded text run. Unicode defines spaces and punctuation as having neutral
      directionality and defines directionality for these neutral characters when they appear
      between characters having a strong directionality (most characters that are not spaces or
      punctuation). While the default direction is often sufficient to determine the correct
      directionality of the language, sometimes it renders the characters incorrectly (for example,
      a question mark at the end of a Hebrew question may appear at the beginning of the question
      instead of at the end or a parenthesis may render incorrectly). To control this behavior, the
      dir attribute is set to "ltr" or "rtl" as needed, to ensure that the desired direction is
      applied to the characters that have neutral bidirectionality. The "ltr" and "rtl" values
      override only the neutral characters (e.g. spaces and punctuation), not all Unicode
      characters. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Problems with Unicode rendering may be caused by the rendering mechanism.
       The problems are not due to the XML markup itself. </div>
</li>

     <li class="li">Sometimes you may want to override the default directionality for strongly bidirectional
      characters. Overrides are done using the "lro" and "rlo" values, which overrides the Unicode
      Bidirectional algorithm. This override forces a direction on the contents of the element.
      These override attributes give the author a brute force way of setting the directionality
      independent of the Unicode Bidirectional algorithm. The gentler "ltr" and "rtl" values have a
      less radical effect, only affecting punctuation and other so-called neutral characters. </li>

    </ul>
</div>

   <p class="p">For most authoring needs, the "ltr" and "rtl" values are sufficient. Only when the desired
    effect cannot be achieved using these values, should the override values be used. </p>

   
  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Implementation precautions</h2>
   
   
   <p class="p">Applications that process DITA documents, whether at the authoring, translation, publishing,
    or any other stage, should fully support the Unicode bidirectional algorithm to correctly
    implement the script and directionality for each language used in the document.
    </p>

   <p class="p">Applications should ensure every highest level topic element and the root map element
    explicitly assign the dir attribute, as well as the xml:lang attribute. </p>
