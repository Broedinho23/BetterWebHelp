      <p class="p">The @conaction attribute reverses the direction of reuse from pull to push. When the
       @conref or @conkeyref attribute is used in combination with the @conaction attribute, content
       can be rendered before, after, or in place of the referenced element, depending on the value
       of the @conaction attribute. See <a class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="common/theconactionattribute.html" title="The conaction attribute allows users to push content from one topic into another. It causes the conref attribute to work in reverse, so that the content is pushed from the current topic into another, rather than pulled from another topic into the current one.">The conaction attribute</a> for more
       details.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The @conaction and @conrefend attributes cannot both be used within the same referencing

     </dd>

    
   </dl>

   <p class="p">The identifier for the referenced element must be either absolute or resolvable in the context
    of the referencing element.</p>

   <p class="p">More formally, the DITA @conref attribute can be considered a transclusion mechanism similar
    to XInclude and to HyTime value references. DITA differs from these mechanisms, however, in that
    conref validity does not apply simply to the current content at the time of replacement, but to
    the ranges of possible content given the constraints of both the referencing document type and
    the referenced document type. DITA compares the constraints of each context to ensure the
    continued validity of the replacement content in its new context. A conref processor must not
    permit resolution of a reuse relationship that could be rendered invalid under the rules of
    either the reused or reusing content.</p>

   <p class="p">When pulling content with the conref mechanism â€“ if the referenced element is the same type as
    the referencing element, and the list of domains declared on the <span class="keyword">domains</span>
    attribute in the referenced topic or map instance is the same as or a subset of the list of
    domains declared in the referencing document, the element set allowed in the referenced element
    is guaranteed to be the same as, or a subset of, the element set allowed in the referencing
    element. A processor resolving a conref should tolerate specializations of valid elements and
    should generalize elements in the pulled content fragment as needed for the referencing
    context.</p>

   <p class="p">When pushing content with the conref mechanism, the domain checking algorithm is reversed. In
    this case, the domains attribute on the referenced document's topic or map must be the same
    as or a superset of the domains declared on the referencing document. Once again, a processor
    resolving a conref should tolerate specializations of valid elements and should generalize
    elements in the pushed content fragment as needed for the referenced context.</p>

   <p class="p">All replacement of content based on @conref occurs after parsing of the document but prior to
    any styling or other transformational or presentational operations on the full topic.</p>

   <p class="p">The referenced element may replace the referencing element based on build-time or runtime
    conditions. For example, content such as product names or install paths may differ from one
    product to another. It is advantageous to separate such content from topic content which is
    reused for more than one product. When the content is reused in a different context, different
    resources are substituted as reference elements.
    </p>

   <p class="p">A fragment of DITA content, such as an XML document containing only a single paragraph without
    a topic or map ancestor, does not contain enough information for the conref processor to be able
    to determine the validity of a reference to it. Consequently, the value of a conref must specify
    a referenced element within a DITA topic or DITA map (or it may point to the entire topic or
    map). </p>

   <div class="p">The attribute specifications on the resolved element can be drawn from both the referencing
    element and the referenced element, according to the following priority:<ol class="ol">
     <li class="li">All attributes as specified on the referencing element, except for attributes which specify
      the value "-dita-use-conref-target". (The term "target" here refers to the referenced
      element.)</li>

     <li class="li">All attributes as specified on the referenced element except:<ol class="ol" type="a">
       <li class="li">The id attribute</li>

       <li class="li">Any attribute that is also specified on the referencing element, except when the value
        specified on the referencing element is "-dita-use-conref-target"</li>

      </ol>
</li>

     <li class="li">The xml:lang attribute has special treatment as described in <a class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="xmllang.html" title="The @xml:lang attribute specifies the language (and optionally the locale) of the element content. The @xml:lang attribute applies to all attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless it is overridden with @xml:lang on another element within that content. If the @xml:lang attribute on the document (outermost) element of a map or of a top-level topic has no value, the processor should assume a default value. The default value of the processor may be either fixed, configurable, or derived from the content itself, such as the @xml:lang attribute on the primary map file. As the default value of a processor may be fixed, it is strongly recommended that the @xml:lang attribute be set on each map and top-level topic.">The @xml:lang attribute</a>.</li>

    </ol>
</div>

   <p class="p">The only time the resolved element would include an attribute whose specified value is
    "-dita-use-conref-target" is when the referenced element had that attribute specified with the
    "-dita-use-conref-target" value and the referencing element either had no specification for that
    attribute or had it also specified with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value. If the final
    resolved element (after the complete resolution of any conref chain, as explained below) has an
    attribute with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value, that should be treated as equivalent to
    having that attribute unspecified.</p>

   <p class="p">A given attribute value on the resolved element comes in its entirety from either the
    referencing element or the referenced element; the attribute values of the referencing and
    referenced elements for a given attribute are never additive, even if the property (such as the
    audience type) takes a list of values.</p>

   <p class="p">If the referenced element has a @conref attribute specified, the above rules should be applied
    recursively with the resolved element from one referencing/referenced combination becoming one
    of the two elements participating in the next referencing/referenced combination. The result
    should preserve without generalization all elements that are valid in the originating context,
    even if they are not valid in an intermediate context. For example, if topicA and topicC allow
    highlighting, and topicB does not, then a content reference chain of
    topicA-&gt;topicB-&gt;topicC should preserve any highlighting elements in the referenced
    content. The result, however it is achieved, must be equivalent to the result of resolving the
    conref pairs recursively starting from the original referencing element in topicA.</p>

   <p class="p">The @conrefend attribute is used when referencing a range of elements with the conref
    mechanism. The @conref attribute references the first element in the range, while @conrefend
    points to the last element in the range. Although the start and end referenced elements must
    both be of the same type as the referencing element (or specialized from that element type), the
    intermediary, contiguous nodes in the middle of the range do not have to be the same.</p>
