  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Attribute generalization</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">There is a particular syntax to generalize attributes that have been specialized from
    the @props or @base attribute. Specialization-aware processors <span class="keyword">should</span> be able
    to recognize and process both the specialized and generalized forms of an attribute as being
    equivalent in their values.</p>

    <p class="p">When a specialized attribute is generalized to an ancestor attribute, the value of the
      ancestor attribute consists of the name of the specialized attribute followed by its
      specialized value in parentheses. For example, given that "jobrole" is an attribute
      specialized from "person", which in turn is specialized from "props":</p>

    <ul class="ul" id="attributegeneralize__ul_6BCECC8F518A421E94E4319755C102D5">
      <li class="li" id="attributegeneralize__li_A44359339EE446539903A0B26FE898BE">jobrole="programmer" can be generalized to
        person="jobrole(programmer)" or to props="jobrole(programmer)"</li>

      <li class="li" id="attributegeneralize__li_D5E2DA845D944AE9975D7AF4A96B39BC">props="jobrole(programmer)" can be respecialized
        to person="jobrole(programmer)" or to jobrole="programmer"</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="p">In this example, generalization and respecialization can use the @domains attribute to
      determine the ancestry of the specialized @jobrole attribute, and therefore the validity of
      the specialized @person attribute as an intermediate target for generalization.</p>

    <p class="p">If more than one attribute is generalized, the value of each is separately represented in
      this way in the value of the ancestor attribute.</p>

    <p class="p">Generalized attributes are typically not expected to be authored or edited directly, but are
      used by generalizing processors to preserve the values of the specialized attributes during
      the time or in the circumstances in which the document is in a generalized form.</p>

    <div class="p">A single element <span class="keyword">may not</span> contain both generalized and specialized values
      for the same attribute. For example, this element:
      <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;p person="jobrole(programmer)" jobrole="admin"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
provides
      two values for the @jobrole attribute, but one is in a generalized syntax and the other in a
      specialized syntax. This is an error condition, since it means the document has been only
      partially generalized, or has been generalized and then edited using a specialized document
      type. </div>
