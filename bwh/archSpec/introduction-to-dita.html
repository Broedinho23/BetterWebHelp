    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML-based architecture for
        authoring, producing, and delivering topic-oriented, information-typed content that can be
        reused and single-sourced in a variety of ways. While DITA historically has been driven by
        the requirements of large-scale technical documentation authoring, management, and delivery,
        it is a standard that is applicable to any kind of publication or information that might be
        presented to readers, including interactive training and educational materials, standards,
        reports, business documents, trade books, travel and nature guides, and more. </p>

        <p class="p">DITA is designed for creating new document types and describing new information domains
            based on existing types and domains. The process for creating new types and domains is
            called specialization. Specialization enables the creation of very specific, targeted
            document-type definitions that still can share the common output transformations and
            design rules developed for more general types and domains; this is similar to how
            classes in an object-oriented system can inherit the methods of ancestor classes.</p>

        <p class="p">Because DITA topics are XML conforming, they can be readily viewed, edited, and validated
            using standard XML tools, although realizing the full potential of DITA requires using
            DITA-aware tools.</p>

<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/about_specification_source.html">About the specification source</a><br/>
The DITA specification is authored as a DITA content set and published using the DITA   Open Toolkit. It is an example of a complex document that is developed by a team of people and   uses many DITA features, including key references (keyrefs) and content references   (conrefs).</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/dita-terminology.html">DITA terminology and notation</a><br/>
The DITA specification uses specific notation and terms to define the           components of the DITA standard.           </li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/basic-concepts.html">Basic concepts</a><br/>
DITA has been designed to satisfy requirements for information typing, semantic markup, modularity, reuse, interchange, and production of  different deliverable forms from a single source. These topics provide an overview of the key DITA features and facilities that serve to satisfy these requirements.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/fileext.html">File naming conventions</a><br/>
DITA uses certain naming conventions and file extension for topics, maps, modules, and     document-type implementation files.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/single_sourcing.html">Producing different deliverables from a single source</a><br/>
DITA is designed to produce multiple deliverable formats from a single set of DITA   content. This means that many rendition details are specified neither in the DITA specification   nor in the DITA content; the rendition details are defined and controlled by the   processors.</li>
