<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The DITA 1.2 Learning and Training specialization addresses
several key problems facing developers and consumers of instructional
content.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">Today's learners confront a complex world with many inter-related
bits and pieces of information, many different ways to access that
information, and a strong need to identify the connection points,
the objectives, and the context for what to know and what to learn. </p>
<div class="p">In this environment, developers of learning and training content
face many challenges, including:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">How to find the context for developing and delivering the right
content to the right person at the right time? </li>

<li class="li">How to identify the learning goals and objectives?</li>

<li class="li">Who and how many are the audiences? </li>

<li class="li">How to pull together and integrate content from many different
sources and content providers? </li>

<li class="li">How to enable customers and partners to add, integrate, assemble,
and deliver their own content?</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">These key challenges and issues for delivery of learning
and training content mirror long-standing pain points and requirements
for content delivery in general. <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Content consumers value consistency of content and learning experiences. </li>

<li class="li">They desire management of content to make it shareable across
and within teams. </li>

<li class="li">They seek to simplify the information needed to support the complex
environments. </li>

<li class="li">Finally, they want a content development process that can enable
the assembly and delivery of custom content that addresses specific
learning contexts and use cases.</li>

</ul>
