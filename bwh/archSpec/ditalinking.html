      <h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA linking</h1>

      
      <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph" id="shortdesc">DITA depends heavily on links. The purposes for which it
                  provides links include defining the content and organization of publication
                  structures (DITA maps), topic-to-topic navigation links and cross references, and
                  reuse of content by reference. All DITA links use the same addressing facilities,
                  either URI-based addresses or DITA-specific indirect addresses using keys and key
                  references.</span></p>

            <p class="p">At its most general, a link establishes a relationship among two or more objects. In
                  DITA, relationships are among DITA elements and either other DITA elements or
                  non-DITA resources, such as Web pages. Relationships may be explicitly typed in
                  some cases (relationship tables and subject scheme maps for example) but are not
                  always associated with a specific relationship type.</p>

            
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For example, a &lt;keyword&gt; element that uses a key
                  reference to link to the definition of the keyword can be considered to be
                  establishing a "mention-of" relationship from the &lt;keyword&gt; element to the
                  definition and a "definition-of" relationship from the definition to the
                  &lt;keyword&gt; element. But those link types are not formally defined either in the
                  DITA definition of &lt;keyword&gt; or in the markup for the &lt;keyword&gt; element
                  itself. While DITA enables the formal definition of typed relationships for some
                  types of link elements, it does not require that all links be formally typed and
                  does not provide a general mechanism for associating explicit link types with
                  links. </div>

            <p class="p">In the abstract, link relationships may be explicit, defined directly by some type of
                  markup in the source data, or implicit, implied by properties of the content that
                  a processor uses to infer relationships (for example, matching the content of a
                  &lt;keyword&gt; element to the title of a topic of a specific topic type). DITA
                  formally defines only explicit links, although processors <span class="keyword">may</span>
                  implement implicit links.</p>

            <p class="p">A link may establish either a navigation relationship or a use-by-reference
                  relationship (e.g., content references). Navigation relationships are used
                  primarily to enable navigation from one element to another, although they may also
                  be used for other purposes, such as classification, or association of metadata.
                  Use-by-reference relationships establish the effective structure and content of
                  the information set.</p>

            <p class="p">An element that establishes one or more such relationships is a "link-defining
                  element". Some element types, such as &lt;link&gt; and &lt;xref&gt;, are always
                  link-defining elements. Other element types become link-defining elements when
                  they use specific link-defining attributes. </p>

            <p class="p">Almost any element may become a use-by-reference link by using the @conref or
                  @conkeyref attribute to establish a content reference (conref) relationship to
                  another element or set of elements (see <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/conref.html#conref" title="The DITA @conref, @conkeyref, @conrefend, and related attributes provide a mechanism for reuse of content fragments within DITA topics or maps.">Use by reference</a>). Elements such as
                  &lt;term&gt; and &lt;keyword&gt; may become navigation links by using the @keyref
                  attribute to establish a relationship to another DITA element or non-DITA
                  resource. </p>

            <p class="p">In general, elements within topics that take both the @href and @keyref attributes
                  always act as elements that define a navigation link, while elements that take
                  @keyref but not @href act as elements that define a navigation link only when they
                  specify @keyref.</p>

            <p class="p">A given link-defining element may establish more than one relationship. For example,
                  an element may establish both a content reference link and a navigation link. A
                  single row in a relationship table may establish a number of distinct
                  relationships among the topics referenced in the different cells of the
                  relationship table. A topic reference within a hierarchy of topic references
                  establishes not only a use-by-reference relationship from the map to the topic,
                  but also hierarchical relationships from the referenced topic to other topics in
                  the navigation hierarchy (parents, siblings, and children). </p>

            <p class="p">DITA defines two forms of addresses for use in defining links, direct URI-based
                  addresses and indirect key references. In all cases, the nature of the
                  relationships established is independent of the form of address used. For example,
                  a cross reference that uses a key reference to address the target of the cross
                  reference is functionally equivalent to having addressed the same target by URI
                  reference, in that the final processing result should be the same in both cases.
                  However, the two forms of address have different practical and intermediate
                  processing implications. See <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/ditaaddressing.html#id" title="DITA provides a number of facilities for establishing relationships among DITA elements and between DITA elements and non-DITA resources. All DITA relationships use the same addressing facilities irrespective of the semantics of the relationship established. DITA addresses are either direct, URI-based addresses, or indirect key-based addresses. Within DITA documents, individual elements are addressed by unique IDs specified on the common @id attribute. DITA defines two fragment identifier syntaxes for addressing DITA elements, one for topics and elements within maps and one for non-topic elements within topics.">DITA addressing</a>.</p>

            <p class="p">Links from maps to other maps, topics, or non-DITA resources establish explicit
                  dependencies from the map containing the links to the associated resources. Links
                  from maps to maps create a "map tree". The set of dependencies for a root map is
                  the union of the dependencies of all the maps in the map tree.</p>

            <p class="p">Links from a topic to other topics, maps, or non-DITA resources establish explicit
                  dependencies from the topic containing the links to the associated resources, and
                  implicit dependencies from any maps that use that linking topic to its
                  dependencies. </p>

            <p class="p">For the purposes of determining the set of dependencies for a given map tree,
                  processors <span class="keyword">may</span> ignore any implicit dependencies created by
                  links within topics that are not also established by explicit dependencies in the
                  map tree. In the case where a map includes a topic that includes a topic-to-topic
                  link, where the linked topic is not explicitly included in the map, and the
                  processor considers only dependencies that are explicitly defined in the map, the
                  processor may fail to resolve the topic-to-topic link. This case can be avoided by
                  using a resource-only topic reference in the map tree to establish the dependency
                  explicitly. If the resource-only topicref also defines a key, the link within the
                  topic can then be changed to use a key reference (@keyref or @conkeyref) instead
                  of a URI reference (@href, @conref). See <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/key-based_addressing.html" title="The DITA key-reference mechanism provides a layer of abstraction so that the resources addressed by references can be defined globally at the DITA map level instead of locally in each topic.">Key-based addressing</a>.</p>

            <p class="p">Navigation links have an associated "scope" indicating the closeness of the
                  relationship of the linking element to associated resources. See <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../common/thescopeattribute.html#thescopeattribute" title="The scope attribute identifies the closeness of the relationship between the current document and the target resource.">The
                        scope attribute</a>.</p>

            <p class="p">Most navigation links have an associated "link text", which is the text used to
                  render the link so that it can be used. For all elements that allow or require
                  link text, the link text may be specified as part of the linking element or, if
                  unspecified, should be taken from the referenced resource. The details for how the
                  link text for a given element should or may be generated are defined for that
                  element type and may also be determined entirely by a rendition processor. </p>

            <p class="p">In the specific case of cross references created using &lt;xref&gt; and related links
                  using &lt;link&gt;, the potential set of rules for constructing link text is
                  essentially unbounded. Processors <span class="keyword">may</span>, for example, define
                  conventions for the value of @outputclass by which authors can indicate the
                  details of how the link text should be constructed, or they may provide
                  appropriate configuration options for controlling or customizing the construction
                  of link text in cross references.</p>
