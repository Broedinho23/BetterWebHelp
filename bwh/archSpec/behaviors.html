    <h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA processing</h1>

    <p class="shortdesc">Several common DITA processing behaviors are driven by attributes, including setting
        the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which a DITA document depends, navigation,
        linking, content reuse (via direct or indirect addressing), conditional processing,
        chunking, and printing. In addition, translation of DITA content is expedited through the
        use of the @dir, @translate, and @xml:lang attributes, and the &lt;index-sort-as&gt;
        element.</p>

<div xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="related-links">
<ol class="olchildlinks">
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/module-compatibility.html">Module compatibility and the @domains attribute</a><br/>
A given DITA document declares, through the @domains attribute on &lt;map&gt; and   &lt;topic&gt; elements, the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which it depends.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/ditanav.html">Navigation behaviors</a><br/>
DITA includes markup that processors may use to generate reader navigation to or           across DITA topics.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/ditalinking.html">DITA linking</a><br/>
<span class="ph">DITA depends heavily on links. The purposes for which it                   provides links include defining the content and organization of publication                   structures (DITA maps), topic-to-topic navigation links and cross references, and                   reuse of content by reference. All DITA links use the same addressing facilities,                   either URI-based addresses or DITA-specific indirect addresses using keys and key                   references.</span></li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/ditaaddressing.html">DITA addressing</a><br/>
<span class="ph"> DITA provides a number of facilities for establishing relationships    among DITA elements and between DITA elements and non-DITA resources. All DITA relationships use    the same addressing facilities irrespective of the semantics of the relationship established.    DITA addresses are either direct, URI-based addresses, or indirect key-based addresses. Within    DITA documents, individual elements are addressed by unique IDs specified on the common @id    attribute. DITA defines two fragment identifier syntaxes for addressing DITA elements, one for    topics and elements within maps and one for non-topic elements within topics.</span></li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/conref.html">Content inclusion (conref)</a><br/>
<span class="ph">The DITA @conref, @conkeyref, @conrefend, and related attributes    provide a mechanism for reuse of content fragments within DITA topics or maps. </span></li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/condproc.html">Conditional processing (profiling)</a><br/>
<span class="ph">Attribute-based profiling, also known as conditional processing or       applicability, is the use of classifying metadata that enables the filtering, flagging,       searching, indexing, and other processing based on the association of an element with one or       more values in a specific classification domain.</span></li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/chunking.html">Chunking</a><br/>
Content may be chunked (divided or merged into new output documents) in different ways       for the purposes of authoring, for delivering content, and for navigation. For example,       something best authored as a set of separate topics may need to be delivered as a single Web       page. A map author can use the chunk attribute to split up multi-topic documents into       component topics or combine multiple topics into a single document as part of output       processing.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/printing.html">Printing</a><br/>
By default, the content of most elements is included in all output media. The DITA map   provides a means to suppress element content from appearing in print-oriented media, or from   appearing in non-print-oriented media, such as HTML. The generation or non-generation of print and   other forms of output can also be affected through the use of other navigation-related attributes. </li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../archSpec/translation.html">Translation and localization</a><br/>
DITA has features that facilitate preparing content for translation and   working with multilingual content, including the @xml:lang attribute, the @dir attribute, and the   @translate attribute. In addition, the &lt;index-sort-as&gt; element provides support for index   sorting in languages in which the index sort order must be modified by the author or   translator.</li>
