 <h1 class="title topictitle1">A learning objects approach to learning and training content</h1>

 
 <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The DITA Learning and Training specialization applies DITA principles and best practices
  for using topic-based and modular content to plan, develop, and deliver learning and training
  content.</p>

  <div class="section">
   <p class="p">The reusable learning objects, or RLO, approach to learning content derives from the
    pioneering work of learning content designers at several companies, including Autodesk®,
    Oracle®, and Cisco®. Author Peder Jacobsen defines an RLO as "a discrete reusable collection of
    content used to present and support a single learning objective." With this approach, it is
    possible to gather a pool of information objects and make them available for reuse and
    repurposing in a variety of learning delivery contexts.</p>

   <p class="p">There is a strong affinity between the DITA topic-based, modular approach to content in
    general, and the learning objects approach to learning content in particular.</p>

   <div class="p">Working assumptions about learning content and how to support authoring and delivering it with
    DITA include the following: <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">The DITA Learning and Training specialization builds on a reusable learning objects (RLO)
      approach to learning content. </li>

     <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">topic types</strong> are the basic building blocks for learning objects and specify the
      meaning and intention of content provided in instructional and information objects.</li>

     <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">domains</strong> provide the mechanism for defining <em class="ph i">interactions</em>, which can be
      used across the learning topic types.</li>

     <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">domains</strong> also provide the mechanism for defining learning <em class="ph i">metadata</em>, which
      can be assigned either in topics or in maps.</li>

     <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">maps</strong> arrange the DITA learning topics into a hierarchy of learning objects and
      group such content for delivery as lessons, modules, and courses.</li>

     <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">specialization </strong>provides the mechanism for creating the learning-based topic
      types, domains, and maps needed for instructional and information object content
      requirements.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="p">This figure shows the composition of learning objects as a) instructional objects, b)
     information objects, and c) the specialized DITA topic types to support them.</p>

    <div class="p">In this approach, a learning object comprises a "discrete reusable collection of content used
     to present and support a single learning objective," and consists of two primary information
     components: <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">instructional objects</strong>, which provide the structured framework for a learning
       experience. The learningOverview, learningSummary, and learningAssassessment topic types
       provide content for instructional objects.</li>

      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">information objects</strong>, which provide the source learning content - the topic-based
       learning content and other supplemental content that supports the learning goals identified
       in the instructional objects. The learningContent topic type provides content for information
       objects.</li>

      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">instructional plans</strong>, which identify the learning goals, needs, and objectives. The
       learningPlan topic type provides content for instructional plans.</li>

     </ul>

    <div class="p">In this approach, a learning content developer:<ol class="ol">
      <li class="li">Uses <strong class="ph b">learning map elements</strong> to identify the learning objects and the supporting
       content needed to address specific learning goals and objectives.</li>

      <li class="li">Uses <strong class="ph b">learning topic elements</strong> to structure the learning content.</li>

      <li class="li">Applies <strong class="ph b">learning metadata elements</strong> to describe specific characteristics of the
       learning content, following a sub-set of the IEEE LOM standard.</li>

      
      <li class="li">Constructs <strong class="ph b">specific build maps and relationship tables</strong> to organize learning objects
       for delivery as a course with specific output and delivery needs.</li>

      <li class="li">Invokes <strong class="ph b">processing</strong> to generate specific learning deliverables, based on the default
       processing available with DITA content and specialized as needed for learning-specific
       purposes and delivery formats.</li>
