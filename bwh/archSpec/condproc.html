<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph" id="shortdesc">Attribute-based profiling, also known
as conditional processing or       applicability, is the use of classifying
metadata that enables the filtering, flagging,       searching, indexing,
and other processing based on the association of an element with one
or       more values in a specific classification domain.</span></p>

<p class="p">DITA defines attributes that are specifically intended to enable
filtering or flagging of individual elements. Those attributes are
@audience, @platform, @product, @otherprops, @props, <span class="ph">and @rev (flagging only).</span> This enables
the creation of topics and maps that can be dynamically configured
at  processing time to reflect a specific set of conditions, using
the DITA-defined conditional processing profile (DITAVAL).</p>

<p class="p">Processors should be able to perform filtering and flagging using
the attributes listed above. Although metatdata elements exist with
similar names, such as the &lt;audience&gt;       element, processors
are not required to perform conditional processing using metadata
      elements. The @props attribute can be specialized to create
new attributes, and processors       should be able to perform conditional
processing on specializations of @props.</p>

<div class="section" id="condproc__condprocattrs"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conditional processing attributes</h2>              <p class="p">For a topic or topicref, the audience, platform, and product
metadata can be expressed with         attributes on the topic or
topicref element or with elements within the topic prolog or     
   topicmeta element. While the metadata elements are more expressive,
the meaning of the         values is the same, and can be used in
coordination. For example, the prolog elements can         fully define
the audiences for a topic, and then metadata attributes can be used
within the         content to identify parts that apply to only some
of those audiences.</p>
       <dl class="dl">

<dt class="dt dlterm">audience</dt>

<dd class="dd">The values in the audience attribute may also be used to reference
a more complete             description of an audience in an audience
element. Use the name of the audience in the             audience
element when referring to the same audience in an audience attribute.<p class="p">The               audience attribute takes a space-delimited list
of values, which may or may not match               the name value
of any audience elements.</p>
           </dd>



<dt class="dt dlterm">platform</dt>

<dd class="dd">The platform might be the operating system, hardware, or other
environment. This             attribute is equivalent to the platform
element for the topic metadata.</dd>

<dd class="dd">             <p class="p">The platform attribute takes a space-delimited
list of values, which may or may not               match the content
of a platform element in the prolog.</p>
           </dd>



<dt class="dt dlterm">product</dt>

<dd class="dd">The product or component name, version, brand, or internal code
or number. This             attribute is equivalent to the prodinfo
element for the topic metadata.</dd>

<dd class="dd">             <p class="p">The product attribute takes a space-delimited
list of values, which may or may not               match the value
of the prodname element in the prolog.</p>
           </dd>



<dt class="dt dlterm">rev</dt>

<dd class="dd">The identifier for the revision level. For example, if a paragraph
was changed or             added during revision 1.1, the rev attribute
might contain the value "1.1". </dd>



          <dt class="dt dlterm">otherprops</dt>

          <dd class="dd">A catch-all for metadata qualification values about the content. This attribute is equivalent to the othermeta element for the topic metadata. <p class="p">The attribute takes a space-delimited list of values, which may or may not match the values of othermeta elements in the prolog.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a simple otherprops value list: <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;codeblock otherprops="java cpp"&gt;</samp></p>
<p class="p">The attribute <dfn class="term">may</dfn> take labeled groups of values as for @props. Processors <dfn class="term">may</dfn> treat such values as equivalent to @props or they <dfn class="term">may</dfn> treat such values as simple strings. The use of labeled groups in @otherprops is deprecated in favor of using specializations of @props. Processors <dfn class="term">should</dfn> clearly document how they treat grouped @otherprops values.

<div class="section" id="condproc__proccondatts"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Evaluating conditional processing
attributes</h2>              <p class="p">At processing time, a DITAVAL conditional
processing profile may be used to specify values         you want
to include, exclude, or flag. </p>
       <div class="p">For example, a publisher
producing information for a mixed audience using the basic product
        could choose to flag information that applies to administrators,
and exclude information         that applies to the extended product,
by defining a conditional processing profile like         this:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;val&gt;
  &lt;prop att="audience" val="administrator" action="flag"&gt;
    &lt;startflag&gt;&lt;alt-text&gt;ADMIN&lt;/alt-text&gt;&lt;/startflag&gt;
  &lt;/prop&gt;
  &lt;prop att="product" val="extendedprod" action="exclude"/&gt;
&lt;/val&gt;</pre>
</div>
       <p class="p">At output time, the paragraph is
flagged, and the first list item is excluded (since it         applies
to extendedprod), but the second list item is still included (even
though it does         apply to extendedprod, it also applies to basicprod,
which was not excluded).</p>
       <div class="p">The result should look something
like: <div class="fig fignone">
<div class="p"><strong class="ph b">ADMIN</strong> Set the configuration options: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Set your blink rate</li>

<li class="li">Do some other stuff </li>

<li class="li">Do a special thing for Linux</li>

</ul>

     </div>

<div class="section" id="condproc__filterlogic"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filtering logic</h2>         
    <p class="p">By default, values in conditional processing attributes that
are not defined in a DITAVAL         profile evaluate to "include".
For example, if the value audience="novice" is used on a         paragraph,
but this value is not defined in a DITAVAL profile, the attribute
evaluates to         "include". However, the DITAVAL profile may change
this default to "exclude", so that any         value not explicitly
defined in the DITAVAL profile will evaluate to "exclude". The profile
        may also be used to change the default for a single attribute;
for example, it may declare         that values in the platform attribute
default to exclude while those in the product         attribute default
to include. See <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/../common/about-ditaval.html" title="A conditional processing profile (DITAVAL file) is used to identify which values are to be used for conditional processing during a particular output, build, or some other purpose. The profile should have an extension of .ditaval.">DITAVAL elements</a> for
        information on how to set up a DITAVAL profile and how to
change default behaviors.</p>
       <div class="p">When deciding whether to include
or exclude a particular element, a processor should         evaluate
each attribute, and then evaluate the set of attributes. <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If <strong class="ph b">all</strong> the values in a single attribute evaluate to "exclude",
the attribute             evaluates to "exclude".</li>

<li class="li">If <strong class="ph b">any single attribute</strong> evaluates to exclude, the element
is excluded.</li>

</ul>
</div>
       <p class="p">For example, if a paragraph applies to three products
and the publisher has chosen to         exclude all of them, the processor
should exclude the paragraph. This is true even if the         paragraph
applies to an audience or platform that is not excluded. But if the
paragraph         applies to an additional product that has not been
excluded, then its content is still         relevant for the intended
output and should be preserved.</p>
     </div>

<div class="section" id="condproc__flaglogic"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Flagging logic</h2>            
 <p class="p">When deciding whether to flag a particular element, a processor
should evaluate each value.         Wherever a value that has been
set as flagged appears in its attribute (for example,         audience="administrator")
the process should add the flag. When multiple flags apply to a  
      single element, multiple flags should be rendered, typically
in the order they are         encountered.</p>
       <p class="p">Flagging could
be done using text (for example, bold text against a colored background)
or         using images. When the same element evaluates as both flagged
and filtered (for example,         flagged because of an audience
attribute value and filtered because of its product attribute    
    values), the element should be filtered.</p>
