<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Topic orientation does not mean that transitions cannot
be authored in DITA. The key  to providing both locational independence
and intentional sequences is the adroit use of  DITA markup features.</p>

<p class="p">The print attribute on the topicref element includes
the value, "printonly",             which may be used to indicate
that the topic be omitted when the DITA map is transformed to a format
for which transitions are unnecessary. Consequently, a topic designated
as "printonly" may be written in any style that serves as a transitional
topic in the flow of printed information. </p>

<p class="p">You can also use conditional text to insert transitional sequences
into a map so that you can include or exclude the content of short
descriptions or paragraphs at the end of a topic. However, if you
share conditionally marked topics with other business partners or
teams, you must instruct them on the proper runtime settings to enable
the conditions to be used the way you intended. </p>

<p class="p">DITA does not preclude authoring transitional text;
it does provide an             environment that allows you to tag
and manage transitional elements apart from             surrounding,
topic-encapsulated information.</p>
