 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Producing different deliverables from a single source</h1>

 
 <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">DITA is designed to produce multiple deliverable formats from a single set of DITA
  content. This means that many rendition details are specified neither in the DITA specification
  nor in the DITA content; the rendition details are defined and controlled by the
  processors.</p>

  
  <div class="p">Like many XML-based applications for human-readable documentation, DITA supports the separation
   of content from presentation. This is necessary when content is used in different contexts, since
   authors cannot predict how or where the material that they author will be used. The following
   features and mechanisms enable users to produce different deliverable formats from a
   single source:<dl class="dl">
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">DITA maps</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Different DITA maps can be optimized for different delivery formats. For example, you might
      have a book map for printed output and another DITA map to generate online help; each map uses
      the same content set.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Specialization</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The DITA specialization facility enables users to create the XML elements needed by a
      particular information set in order to provide appropriate rendition distinctions. In
      XML-based systems where presentation details are defined as styles bound to elements, the more
      precise and detailed the markup, the easier it is to define presentation rendering. Because
      the use of arbitrary specializations does not impede interchange or interoperability, DITA
      users can safely create the specializations demanded by their local delivery and rendition
      requirements, with a minimum of additional impact on the systems and business processes that
      depend on or use the content. While general XML practices suggest that element types should be
      semantic, specialization can be used to define element types that are purely presentational in
      nature. The highlighting domain is an example of such a specialization.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Conditional processing</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Conditional processing makes it possible to have a topic or DITA map that contains
      delivery-specific content.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Content referencing</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The conref mechanism makes it possible to construct delivery-specific maps or topics from a
      combination of generic components and delivery-context-specific components.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Key referencing</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The keyref mechanism makes it possible to change variables for volatile content, redirect
      links, and reap the benefits of indirect addressing.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">@outputclass attribute</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The @outputclass attribute provides a mechanism whereby authors can indicate specific
      rendition intent where necessary. Note that the DITA specification does not define any values
      for the @outputclass attribute; the use of the @outputclass attribute is, by nature, processor
      specific.</dd>

    
   </dl>
</div>

  <p class="p">While DITA is independent of any particular delivery format, it is a standard that supports the
   creation of human-readable content. As such, it defines some fundamental document components
   including paragraphs, lists, and table. When there is a reasonable expectation that such basic
   document components be rendered consistently, the DITA specification defines default or suggested
   renderings.</p>
