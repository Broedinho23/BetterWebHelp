 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Task topic (strict task)</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The strict task document type supports the development of instructions for the
  completion of a procedure. The strict task document type is built using the general task
  information type combined with the Strict Taskbody Constraint. See the reference below to ensure
  that you have the correct task document type when you update to DITA 1.2.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The purpose of the standard task information type</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Tasks are the essential building blocks to provide procedural information. A task information
    type answers the "How do I?" question by providing precise step-by-step instructions detailing
    the requirements that must be fulfilled, the actions that must be performed, and the order in
    which the actions must be performed. The task topic includes sections for describing the
    context, prerequisites, expected results, and other aspects of a task.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The structure of the task topic</h2>
   
   <p class="p">The &lt;task&gt; element is the top-level element for the strict task topic. The strict task
    document type contains a title and a taskbody with optional alternative titles (titlealts), a
    short description or abstract, a prolog,and related-links.</p>

   <p class="p">The &lt;taskbody&gt; element is the main body element inside a strict task document type. The
    strict task body has a constrained structure, with these optional elements in the following
    order: </p>

   <dl class="dl">
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;prereq&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Describes information that the user needs to know or do before starting the immediate task.
      This section may occur only once.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;context&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Provides background information for the task. This information helps the users understand
      the purpose of the task and what they will gain by completing the task correctly. This section
      should be brief and does not replace or recreate a concept topic on the same subject, although
      the context section may include some conceptual information. This section may occur only
      once.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;steps&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Provides the main content of the task topic. A task consists of a series of steps that
      accomplish the task. The &lt;steps&gt; element must have one or more &lt;step&gt; elements, which
      provide the specifics about each step in the task. The &lt;steps&gt; element may occur only
       once.<p class="p">The &lt;step&gt; element represents an action that a user must follow to accomplish a
       task. Each step in a task must contain a command &lt;cmd&gt; element which describes the
       particular action the user must perform to accomplish the overall task. The step element may
       also contain information &lt;info&gt;, substeps &lt;substeps&gt;, tutorial information
       &lt;tutorialinfo&gt;, a step example &lt;stepxmp&gt;, choices &lt;choices&gt;, or a stepresult
       &lt;stepresult&gt;, although these are optional.</p>
</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;steps-unordered&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Provides alternative content for the task topic, allowing for a single step in a procedure
      or a set of commands that need not be performed in a specific order.</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;result&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Describes the expected outcome for the task as a whole. </dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;example&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Provides an example that illustrates or supports the task. </dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">&lt;postreq&gt;</dt>

     <dd class="dd">Describes steps or tasks that the user should do after the successful completion of the
      current task. It is often supported by links to the next task or tasks in the
      &lt;related-links&gt; section.</dd>

  <div class="example">Here is an example of a task
   topic:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;task id="birdhousebuilding"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Building a bird house&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;shortdesc&gt;Building a birdhouse is a perfect activity 
    for adults to share with their children or grandchildren. 
    It can be used to teach about birds, as well as the proper use of tools.
    &lt;/shortdesc&gt;
 &lt;taskbody&gt;
  &lt;context&gt;Birdhouses provide safe locations for birds to build nests and raise their young. They also provide shelter during cold and rainy spells.&lt;/context&gt;
  &lt;prereq&gt;To build a sound birdhouse, you will need a complete set of tools:
  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hand saw&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hammer ... &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/prereq&gt;
 &lt;steps&gt;
   &lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Lay out the dimensions for the birdhouse elements.&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
   &lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Cut the elements to size.&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
   &lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;Drill a 1 1/2" diameter hole for the bird entrance on the front.&lt;/cmd&gt;
         &lt;info&gt;You need to look at the drawing for the correct placement of the 
               hole.&lt;/info&gt;&lt;/step&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/steps&gt;
  &lt;result&gt;You now have a beautiful new birdhouse!&lt;/result&gt;
  &lt;postreq&gt;Now find a good place to mount it.&lt;/postreq&gt;
 &lt;/taskbody&gt;
