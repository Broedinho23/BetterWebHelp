  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Each DITA element declares its specialization hierarchy as the value of the @class
    attribute. The @class attribute usually provides a mapping from the element's current name to
    its more general equivalents, but it can also provide a mapping from the current name to more
    general and more specialized equivalents. All specialization-aware processing can be defined in
    terms of @class attribute values without reference to a given element's tagname.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Specialization hierarchy declaration requirements</h2>
      
      <div class="p">Values for the @class attribute <span class="keyword">must</span> conform to the following syntax
          requirements:<ul class="ul" id="classatt__ul_4df77451-53e8-4261-a212-5f1949d62a59">
          <li class="li">An initial "-" or "+" character followed by one or more spaces, "-" for element types
            defined in structural vocabulary modules, "+" for element types defined in domain
            modules.</li>

          <li class="li">A sequence of one or more module/type pair tokens of the form
              "<var class="keyword varname">modulename</var>/<var class="keyword varname">typename</var>", with each pair of tokens
            separated by one or more spaces, where <var class="keyword varname">modulename</var> is the short name
            of the vocabulary module and <var class="keyword varname">typename</var> is the element type name.
            Tokens are ordered left to right from most general to most specialized. </li>

          <li class="li">At least one trailing space character (" "). The trailing space ensures that string
            matches on module/name pairs can always include a leading and trailing space in order to
            reliably match full tokens. </li>

        </ul>
</div>

      <p class="p">When the @class attribute is declared in a DTD or XSD, it <span class="keyword">must</span> be
        declared with a default value. In order to support generalization round-tripping
        (generalizing specialized content into a generic form and then returning it to the
        specialized form) the default value <span class="keyword">must not</span> be fixed. This allows a
        generalization process to overwrite the default values defined by a general document type
        with specialized values taken from the document being generalized.</p>

      <p class="p">When a vocabulary module declares new element types, it <span class="keyword">must</span> provide a
        @class attribute for each element type that it declares. The @class attribute
          <span class="keyword">must</span> include a mapping for every structural type or domain in the
        specialized type's ancestry, even those in which no element renaming occurred. The mapping
          <span class="keyword">must</span> start with the value for the base type (for example topic or map),
        and finish with the current element type. </p>

      <p class="p">A vocabulary module <span class="keyword">must not</span> change the @class attribute for elements
        that it does not specialize, but simply reuses by reference from more generic levels. For
        example, since task, bctask, and guitask use the &lt;p&gt; element without specializing it,
        they <span class="keyword">must not</span> declare mappings for it. </p>

      <p class="p">The @class attribute <span class="keyword">should not</span> be modified by authors. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examples (non-normative)</h2>
      
      <div class="p">The @class attribute for the task topic type's &lt;step&gt; element
        is:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;!ATTLIST step         class  CDATA "- topic/li task/step "&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">This tells us that the &lt;step&gt; element is equivalent to the &lt;li&gt; element in a generic
        topic. It also tells us that &lt;step&gt; is equivalent to a &lt;step&gt; in a task topic, which
        we already knew, but it's worth noting this in the attribute because it enables round-trip
        migration between upper level and lower level types without loss of information. </p>

      <p class="p">While a given element's tagname is normally the same as the typename of the last token in
        the @class value, this is not required. Processors that perform <dfn class="term">generalization</dfn>
        may transform elements from specialized types to less-specialized types, leaving the values
        of the @class attribute unchanged (thus preserving knowledge of the original
        most-specialized form). For example, if a user runs a generalizing transformation that maps
        all elements to their first @class value, but preserves their content and attribute values,
        then the user can follow it up with a "specialize" transformation that maps all elements to
        their last @class value (preserving content and attribute values), and provide a full round
        trip for all content between the two document types, using nothing but two generic
        transformations and the information in the @class attribute.</p>

      <p class="p">The
        @class attribute tells a processor what general classes of elements the current element
        belongs to. DITA scopes elements by module type (for example topic type, domain type, or map
        type) instead of document type, which lets document type developers combine multiple topic
        types in a single document without complicating transformation logic.</p>

      <p class="p">The sequence of values in the @class attribute is important because it tells processors
        which value is the most general and which is most specific. This is especially important for
        "specializing" transformations, where you can apply a general rule that says: if the element
        doesn't have a mapping to the target topic type, simply use the last value of the @class
        attribute (and assume that the specialized topic type is reusing some general element
        declarations, which only have mappings for the level at which they were declared).</p>

      <div class="p">
        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Example of structural type element with @class attribute</span>
          
          <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;appstep class="- topic/li task/step bctask/appstep "&gt;
  &lt;cmd class="- topic/ph task/cmd "&gt;A specialized step&lt;/cmd&gt;
&lt;/appstep&gt;</pre>

        </div>

        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Example of domain element with @class attribute</span>
          
          <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;wintitle class="+ topic/keyword ui-d/wintitle "&gt;A specialized keyword&lt;/wintitle&gt;</pre>

        </div>

      </div>

      <p class="p">While this example is trivial, more complicated hierarchies (say, five levels deep, with renaming occurring at levels two and four only) make explicit intermediate values essential.</p>

      <p class="p">The specialization hierarchy for a given element type must reflect any intermediate modules between the base type and the specialization type, as shown in this example:</p>

      <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. Example of @class attribute with intermediate value</span>
        
        <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;windowname class="- topic/keyword task/keyword guitask/windowname "&gt;</pre>

      </div>

      <p class="p">The intermediate values are necessary so that generalizing and specializing transformations
        can map values simply and accurately. For example, if task/keyword was missing as a value,
        and a user decided to generalize this guitask up to a task topic, then the transformation
        would have to guess whether to map to keyword (appropriate if task is more general than
        guitask, which it is) or leave it as windowname (appropriate if task were more specialized,
        which it isn't). By always providing mappings for more general values, processors can then
        apply the simple rule that missing mappings must by default be to more specialized values
        than the one we are generalizing to, which means the last value in the list is appropriate.
        For example, when generalizing &lt;guitask&gt; to &lt;task&gt;, if a &lt;p&gt; element has no target
        value for &lt;task&gt;, we can safely assume that &lt;p&gt; does not specialize from &lt;task&gt; and
        should not be generalized.</p>
