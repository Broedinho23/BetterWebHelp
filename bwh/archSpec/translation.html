<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/xmllang.html">The @xml:lang attribute</a><br/>
 The @xml:lang attribute specifies the 	 language (and optionally the locale) of the element content. The @xml:lang 	 attribute applies to all attributes and content of the element where it is 	 specified, unless it is overridden with @xml:lang on another element within 	 that content. If the @xml:lang attribute on the document (outermost) element of 	 a map or of a top-level topic has no value, the processor should assume a 	 default value. The default value of the processor may be either fixed, 	 configurable, or derived from the content itself, such as the @xml:lang 	 attribute on the primary map file. As the default value of a processor may be 	 fixed, it is strongly recommended that the @xml:lang attribute be set on each 	 map and top-level topic.    </li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/diratt.html">The dir attribute</a><br/>
The dir attribute provides direction about how processors should render bidirectional   text. Languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, and Yiddish have text written from right to   left. Numerics and embedded sections of Western language text, however, are written from left to   right. Some multilingual documents also contain a mixture of text segments in two directions. This   attribute specifies how such text should be rendered to a reader.</li>

<div class="parentlink"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class="- topic/link  ajaxLink" href="archSpec/behaviors.html" title="Several common DITA processing behaviors are driven by attributes, including setting the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which a DITA document depends, navigation, linking, content reuse (via direct or indirect addressing), conditional processing, chunking, and printing. In addition, translation of DITA content is expedited through the use of the @dir, @translate, and @xml:lang attributes, and the &lt;index-sort-as&gt; element.">DITA processing</a></div>

The DITA map provides a means to suppress element content from appearing in print-oriented media, or from appearing in non-print-oriented media, such as HTML. The generation or non-generation of print and other forms of output can also be affected through the use of other navigation-related attributes.">Printing</a></div>
